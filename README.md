## Why I made this
I made this because I want to try functional programing in F-Sharp

## How to use
- Type a game room id ( try GameRoom1,GameRoom2,GameRoom3) 
- Type your name
- Select join as black and white
- Type moves in Descriptive Notation

If you want to see the board use an external tool like [FEN Display tool] (http://www.ee.unb.ca/cgi-bin/tervo/fen.pl) and copy the FEN code below into it as visual boards as not being implemented yet
